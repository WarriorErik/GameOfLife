# GameOfLife
This was the game of life that was created during my first Project class, following John Conway's principles first developed at Los Alamos in the 1940s.
The Game of Life's universe is an endlessly expansive, two-dimensional grid made up of square cells, each existing in one of two states: alive or dead, also known as populated or unpopulated. Each cell is surrounded by eight neighboring cells, located next to it either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. With every time increment, the cells undergo the following changes:

- A living cell with less than two living neighbors will perish, akin to dying from underpopulation.
- A living cell with two or three living neighbors will survive into the next generation.
- A living cell with more than three living neighbors will expire, similar to dying from overpopulation.
- A dead cell that has precisely three living neighbors will transform into a living cell, resembling the process of reproduction.
